# Usage Rights

This concept was inspired by several pages on the web so it's not only my effort, you are free to re-use it and modify it as you like for commercial and personal projects.

# How to use it

The code is pretty simple and readable, i only used rem unit so if you want to change the size you just need to change the font-size in the :root
